                <p>My hobby is to play tennis. I actually picked up a racket for the first time 4 years ago. I started playing tennis to become more fit. I can play it with almost anyone and anywhere. I play tennis thrice a week after School. I play tennis around the year in and outdoors with my friends and relatives. Tennis is easy to learn and fun to play. Playing tennis as a hobby is a great way to improve your psychological and physical health. It's easy to play, it's immensely fun, and it's great for your health.</p>
